# Unit test

The unit tests for order book are created using
Microsoft Unit Testing Framework for C++. More info on how to run
the tests can be found at [write unit tests for C/C++ in Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/writing-unit-tests-for-c-cpp?view=vs-2022).

The tests are designed to check the different methods present within
the order book class and verify whether they work as intended or not.
